Adds resource links related to the Genesis Framework to the admin bar.

== Description ==

This plugin adds resources links related to the <a href="http://genesis-theme-framework.com/">Genesis Framework</a> to the admin bar.

These resources include direct links to StudioPress support forums for each theme, quick access to Genesis Theme and SEO settings pages, quick access to Genesis-related plugin settings pages (for those that are active), and links to useful tutorial pages for how to get the most out of Genesis.

The plugin is built with theme and plugin developers in mind, as they can add support for their product with only a few lines of code, giving their users instant access to the right support board, a link to *their* website etc.

* Adds support for menu item positioning, so custom entries can be added anywhere, and not just as the final items.
* Easy addition of Support board links via single lines in theme `functions.php`.

This plugin is conceptual fork of the Genesis Admin Bar Addition plugin, re-written from scratch, adding new features.

Please report issues at https://github.com/GaryJones/Genesis-Admin-Bar-Plus/issues and not the WP Forums.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload `genesis-admin-bar-plus` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Ensure you're displaying the admin bar (front and / or back-end) via the settings on the User Profile page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add my own entries to the Genesis menus? =

Yes - there is an action hook to do this. See the *Add Custom Items* section.

= How do I add a link to a certain support board? =

The plugin currently recognises all of the child theme support boards, <a href="http://genesis-theme-framework.com/">Genesis</a>, the translations board, the general plugins board and the GenesisConnect board.
See the *Add Support Boards* section for an example of how to add these to the Support menu.

You can also add a reference to another board via the `gabp_support_boards` filter.

= What settings links are supported? =
The following theme and plugins, when active, have a link to their settings page added to the Settings submenu:

* Design Settings (for [Prose Theme](http://gmj.to/prose))
* [GenesisConnect](http://gmj.to/genesisconnect)
* [Genesis Simple Breadcrumbs](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/genesis-simple-breadcrumbs/)
* [Genesis Slider](http://www.studiopress.com/plugins/genesis-slider)
* [Genesis Simple Edits](http://www.studiopress.com/plugins/simple-edits)
* [Genesis Simple Hooks](http://www.studiopress.com/plugins/simple-hooks)
* [Genesis Simple Sidebars](http://www.studiopress.com/plugins/simple-sidebars)
* [Simple URLs](http://www.studiopress.com/plugins/simple-urls)

A plugin author can add support for their own settings page link. See the *Add Custom Items* section.

Genesis Simple Menus and Genesis Tabs can't be supported as they have no individual settings pages.

== Screenshots ==

1. Support menu expanded, to show 3 optional items added via theme `functions.php` using `add_theme_support()`
2. Codex menu expanded
3. StudioPress menu expanded, along with FAQ submenu, and with debug mode enabled to show calculated menu positions
4. Settings menu expanded, showing support for direct link to settings pages of several Genesis-related plugins
5. Showing the StudioPress menu item removed, Support menu item moved position and new custom menu items added

== Add Custom Items ==

Here's an example which removes the StudioPress menu (you only need to remove the parent item to remove all of the child items too), moves the Support menu item to the bottom of the submenu and adds some custom menu items in:

`add_action( 'gabp_menu_items', 'child_gabp_menu_items', 10, 3 );
/**
 * Amend the menu items in the Genesis Admin Bar Plus plugin.
 *
 * @param Genesis_Admin_Bar_Plus_Menu $menu
 * @param string $prefix
 * @param string $genesis
 */
function child_gabp_menu_items( $menu, $prefix, $genesis ) {
	$garyjones = $prefix . 'gary-jones';

	// Remove StudioPress item
	$menu->remove_item('studiopress');

	// Add Gary Jones item
	$menu->add_item( 'gary-jones', array(
		'parent'   => $genesis,
		'title'    => 'Gary Jones',
		'href'     => 'http://garyjones.co.uk/',
		'position' => 30
	) );

	// Add Gary Jones submenu items
	$menu->add_item( 'code-gary-jones', array(
		'parent'   => $garyjones,
		'title'    => 'Code Gallery',
		'href'     => 'http://code.garyjones.co.uk/',
		'position' => 10
	) );
	$menu->add_item( 'garyj', array(
		'parent'   => $garyjones,
		'title'    => 'GaryJ',
		'href'     => 'http://twitter.com/GaryJ',
		'position' => 20
	) );

	// Amend position of Support menu item - child items will move correctly too
	// as of v1.1
	$menu->edit_item( 'support', array(
		'position' => 50
	) );
}`

== Add Support Boards ==

To a add a reference to a support board (perhaps for the child theme the active theme is based on, or a plugin the site uses, etc), you can add something like one of the following to the child theme `functions.php` file.
`add_theme_support('gabp-support-genesis'); // Adds direct link to Genesis support board
add_theme_support('gabp-support-pretty-young-thing'); // Adds link to Pretty Young Thing child theme support board
add_theme_support('gabp-support-prose');  // Adds link to Prose child theme support board
add_theme_support('gabp-support-focus'); // Adds link to Focus child theme support board
add_theme_support('gabp-support-translations'); // Adds direct link to Genesis Translations support board
add_theme_support('gabp-support-plugins'); // Adds direct link to StudioPress Plugins support board
add_theme_support('gabp-support-genesisconnect'); // Adds direct link to GenesisConnect support board`
For child themes, the bit after the `gabp-support-` string must be the theme name, lowercase, with spaces replaced with hyphens.
